        <h2>KISAPMATA @ 4pm</h2>
        <h3>Dir. by Mike de Leon</h3> 

            <p>Over the course of an unrelenting 100 minutes, director Mike
                de Leon and co. takes you into the claustrophobic space that 
                is the Carandang home. Its partriach, a retired police officer,
                Sgt. Carandang grasps onto his home with tight grip. His daughter
                Mila intends to marry the father of her child, to which her father
                allows on the condition of an expensice dowry. Once they marry,
                the film depicts the cyclical horrors of its household as its 
                patriarch treis to control everyone in his family, even as they
                try to escape.
            </p>

            <p>De Leon and co. adapt a Nick Joaquin news report about a familicide
                to craft a tale that plays equal parts as a stirring, terrifying 
                horror film, and an allegory for the horrors and oppressions of 
                Philippine people under martial law. Kisapmata is masterfully crafted
                as the film ebbs to the pacings of hybrid lucid dreams and realities.

        <h2>PAN DE SALAWAL @ 7pm</h2>
        <h3>Dir. by Che Espiritu</h3>
           
            <p>At the heart of Pan de Salawal is a young visayan, Aguy (ow!), with the
                ability to heal people by slaping, punching or beating them up. Sal is a
                lonely old man who owns a defunct bakery. As the two begin an eccentric
                friendship, we become acquainted with the folks in sal's community- the
                love story between a sari sari worker and a butcher's son, a former pageant 
                beauty queen with tuberculosis, a barber with arthritis.
            </p>

            <p>Pan de Salawal is a watch that balances its whimsy with slice of life,
                while utilizing its core conceit- magic and healing, to underline and
                subtly critique the flaws of access to healthcare in low income Filipino
                communities.
