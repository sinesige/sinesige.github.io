            <p> Tucked away in a remote forest, the convent of Adoration is inhabited 
                by a group of nuns seeking a peaceful life of devotion and discipline, 
                filling their days with nothing but mundane chores and prayers. But the 
                wish for a life in isolation is threatened when President Ferdinand 
                Marcos declares martial law, and political protests and chaos begin 
                to infiltrate every corner of the archipelago. Suddenly, the nuns find 
                themselves engulfed in violence and unrest that will eventually put their 
                faith and conscience to the test. </p>
