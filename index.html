            <p width="1200">Sine! Sige! (#001) is proud to feature the internationally proclaimed "queen of sensual cinema", 
                filmmaker Isabel Sandoval's breakout third film Lingua Franca.</p>

            <p width="1200">The film follows Olivia, an undocumented migrant worker living as a caretaker as she attempts to 
                figure out how to attain green card status. As her initial opportunities of a marriage of 
                convenience falls through, she becomes involved with her employer’s grandson- a slaughterhouse 
                worker recently returning from rehab. 

                Lingua Franca is a character study- an intimate portrait of transwomanhood, a rendition of 
                post-2016 election america underneath the trump regime and ICE’s violent removals of undocumented 
                citizens, and the socioeconomic politics of care and it’s many forms and transactions.
